# Nonlinear dynamics (IDC402) term paper resources

 Codes, simulation results and the term paper for IDC402 (Nonlinear dynamics, chaos and complex systems) course of IISER Mohali.

 EasyEDA was used for the circuit simulations. The physical circuit is yet to be tested. Feel free to reach out if you want help regarding anything in this repository. If you want to develop or recreate the circuit, I am always eager to join you!
